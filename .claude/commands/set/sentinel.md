# Sentinel — Intelligent Orchestration Supervisor

Start and supervise a `set-orchestrate` run with intelligent crash recovery, checkpoint handling, and completion reporting.

**Arguments:** `[set-orchestrate start options...]`

## Instructions

You are the sentinel — an intelligent supervisor for `set-orchestrate`. Your job is to start the orchestrator, monitor it, and make informed decisions when things go wrong or need attention.

**Key principle: Stay responsive.** Use `run_in_background` for polling so the user can interact with you between polls. Never block the UI with long-running foreground loops.

### Deference Principle

Before acting on any event, classify it into one of two tiers:

| Tier | Action | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1 — Defer** | Do nothing. The orchestrator handles this automatically. | merge-blocked changes, verify/test failures, individual change failures, replan cycles, `waiting:api` loop status |
| **Tier 2 — Act** | Sentinel intervenes (restart, report, or ask user). | Process crash (SIGKILL, OOM, broken pipe), process hang (stale >120s), non-periodic checkpoint, terminal state (done/stopped/time_limit) |
| **Tier 3 — Diagnose & Fix** | Sentinel investigates and fixes. | `integration-failed` changes (orchestrator gave up), stuck pipeline (all changes blocked/failed) |

**When uncertain, default to Tier 1 (defer).** The orchestrator has built-in recovery for:
- **merge-blocked** → `retry_merge_queue` with jq deep-merge resolves package.json conflicts, agent rebase handles others
- **verify/test failures** → `max_verify_retries` and scoped fix cycles retry automatically
- **individual change failed** → orchestrator marks it failed and continues with remaining changes
- **replan cycles** → built-in auto-replan logic re-decomposes when needed
- **waiting:api** → set-loop detects API errors (429, 503) and enters exponential backoff automatically

The sentinel MUST NOT try to fix routine orchestration-level issues (merge-blocked, verify retries). But when the orchestrator has **exhausted its retries** and a change is `integration-failed`, the sentinel takes over.

**Tier 3 — integration-failed recovery:**
When you see a change in `integration-failed` status during a poll:
1. Read the orchestration log (`tail -100` of the log file) to find the merge error
2. Diagnose: what's blocking the merge? (untracked files, conflicts, build errors, etc.)
3. Fix it on the main branch (cd to project root, resolve the issue, commit if needed)
4. Reset the change status back to `done` so the merge queue retries:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json; f='orchestration-state.json'; s=json.load(open(f))
   for c in s['changes']:
       if c['name']=='CHANGE_NAME' and c['status']=='integration-failed':
           c['status']='done'; c['total_merge_attempts']=0
   json.dump(s, open(f,'w'), indent=2)
   "
   ```
5. The orchestrator will pick it up on the next monitor cycle and retry the merge

**Expected patterns (NOT bugs)** — these look like failures but auto-resolve. Do NOT escalate:

| Pattern | Why it's OK | Duration |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Post-merge build fail (prisma generate, codegen) | `post_merge_command` in config handles codegen regeneration | 1-2 min |
| Watchdog "no progress" on fresh dispatch | New agents need startup time before first loop-state.json appears | 2 min grace |
| Stale build cache (`.next/`, `dist/`) | Build retry clears stale caches automatically | 1 build cycle |
| Long MCP fetch (design snapshot, memory) | Heartbeat events confirm liveness during 4-5 min fetches | 4-5 min |
| `waiting:api` loop status | set-loop exponential backoff handles 429/503 automatically | auto-resolve |

### Step 1: Start the orchestrator in background

```bash
# Start orchestrator — all arguments are passed through
set-orchestrate start $ARGUMENTS &
ORCH_PID=$!
echo "Orchestrator started (PID: $ORCH_PID)"
```

Save the PID — you'll need it for every poll.

Initialize your tracking counters:
- `restart_count = 0`
- `rapid_crashes = 0`
- `last_start_time = $(date +%s)`

**Register sentinel status** (so set-web Sentinel tab can detect you):
```bash
set-sentinel-status register --member "$(whoami)@$(hostname -s)" --orchestrator-pid $ORCH_PID
```

Then immediately go to Step 2.

### Step 2: Poll (background, non-blocking)

Run this single-shot poll command with `run_in_background: true`. Replace `$ORCH_PID` with the actual PID number.

**IMPORTANT: Claude Code Bash tool escapes `!` as `\!` which breaks bash syntax. NEVER use `!` in the poll script. Use the workarounds below (kill -0 with || instead of if !, test -f instead of -f inline, etc.)**

```bash
# Split 30s sleep into 10x3s for inbox responsiveness (max 3s message latency)
for _i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; do sleep 3; set-sentinel-inbox check 2>/dev/null || true; done; sleep 3
STATE_FILE="orchestration-state.json"
ORCH_PID=<actual PID number>

# Check if process is alive (avoid "!" — Claude Code escapes it)
ALIVE=true
kill -0 "$ORCH_PID" 2>/dev/null || ALIVE=false
if [ "$ALIVE" = "false" ]; then
    STATUS=$(jq -r '.status // "unknown"' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
    echo "EVENT:process_exit|status=$STATUS"
    exit 0
fi

# Read current state
STATUS=$(jq -r '.status // "unknown"' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Terminal states
if [ "$STATUS" = "done" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "stopped" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "time_limit" ]; then
    echo "EVENT:terminal|status=$STATUS"
    exit 0
fi

# Checkpoint
if [ "$STATUS" = "checkpoint" ]; then
    REASON=$(jq -r '.checkpoints[-1].reason // "unknown"' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
    APPROVED=$(jq -r '.checkpoints[-1].approved // false' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
    if [ "$APPROVED" = "true" ]; then
        echo "EVENT:running|status=checkpoint_approved"
    else
        echo "EVENT:checkpoint|reason=$REASON"
    fi
    exit 0
fi

# Stale detection (use test -f separately to avoid complex [[ ]])
if [ "$STATUS" = "running" ] && test -f "$STATE_FILE"; then
    MTIME=$(stat -c %Y "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %m "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
    NOW=$(date +%s)
    AGE=$(( NOW - MTIME ))
    if [ $AGE -gt 120 ]; then
        echo "EVENT:stale|age=${AGE}s"
        exit 0
    fi
fi

# Quick progress summary
CHANGES_DONE=$(jq '[.changes[] | select(.status == "done" or .status == "merged")] | length' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "?")
CHANGES_TOTAL=$(jq '.changes | length' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "?")
TOKENS=$(jq '.prev_total_tokens // 0' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Token stuck detection: running change >500K tokens with no commit in 30 min
NOW_TS=$(date +%s)
STUCK=$(jq --argjson now "$NOW_TS" '[.changes[] | select(.status == "running") | select((.tokens_used // 0) > 500000) | select(.last_commit_at == null or ((.last_commit_at | sub("\\.[0-9]+$";"") | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S") | mktime) < ($now - 1800)))] | length' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

# Dependency deadlock: pending changes whose deps are ALL failed
DEADLOCKED=$(jq '[.changes[] | select(.status == "pending") | select(.depends_on != null and (.depends_on | length) > 0) | . as $c | select(all(.depends_on[]; . as $dep | [$.changes[] | select(.name == $dep) | .status][0] == "failed"))] | length' "$STATE_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

WARNINGS=""
if [ "$STUCK" -gt 0 ]; then WARNINGS="${WARNINGS}|WARNING:token_stuck=$STUCK"; fi
if [ "$DEADLOCKED" -gt 0 ]; then WARNINGS="${WARNINGS}|WARNING:deadlocked=$DEADLOCKED"; fi

echo "EVENT:running|status=$STATUS|progress=${CHANGES_DONE}/${CHANGES_TOTAL}|tokens=$TOKENS${WARNINGS}"
```

**IMPORTANT:** This command runs in the background. You remain available for user interaction while it sleeps and checks.

**After each poll completes**, emit structured events and check inbox:
```bash
# Heartbeat (keeps set-web Sentinel tab "active" indicator green)
set-sentinel-status heartbeat

# Structured event log (visible in set-web Sentinel tab)
set-sentinel-log poll --state "$STATUS" --change "$(jq -r '[.changes[] | select(.status == "running")][0].name // ""' orchestration-state.json 2>/dev/null)"

# Check inbox for user messages (from set-web Sentinel tab)
set-sentinel-inbox check
```

If `set-sentinel-inbox check` returns messages, read and respond to them before the next poll. Common messages:
- "stop" / "ne restartolj" → set a flag to skip auto-restart on next crash
- "status" → respond with current state summary
- Any other message → acknowledge and log

**When discovering issues during monitoring**, log findings:
```bash
# Example: IDOR vulnerability found
set-sentinel-finding add --severity bug --change "add-cart" --summary "IDOR: cart delete not scoped by sessionId"

# Example: agent stuck in a loop
set-sentinel-finding add --severity pattern --change "add-products" --summary "Agent type error loop (3 iterations)"

# Example: phase assessment
set-sentinel-finding assess --scope "phase-2" --summary "2/4 merged, 1 critical IDOR" --recommendation "Fix IDOR before proceeding"
```

### Step 3: Handle the poll result

When the background poll completes, you'll be notified. Read the output and act based on the EVENT:

#### EVENT: running

**This is the fast path — keep it minimal.** Do NOT analyze, think deeply, or produce lengthy output. Do NOT read logs, do NOT read state beyond the poll output, do NOT analyze individual change statuses.

Just say something brief like: `Orchestration running (3/7 changes, 1.2M tokens). Polling...`

**If WARNING:token_stuck is present**: escalate to user on first detection only. Say: "Warning: N change(s) have used >500K tokens with no commit in 30 min — may be stuck." Then read the state to list which changes are stuck. Track this so you don't repeat the warning every poll.

**If WARNING:deadlocked is present**: escalate to user on first detection only. Read the state to identify the specific changes and their failed dependencies. Say: "Deadlock: N pending change(s) blocked by failed dependencies — manual intervention needed. Run `set-orchestrate reset --partial` or clear deps manually."

**If any change has status `integration-failed`**: this means the orchestrator exhausted its merge retries. Apply **Tier 3** — read the merge log, diagnose the root cause, fix it on main, and reset the change to `done`. Don't defer this — the orchestrator already gave up.

Then **immediately go back to Step 2** (start another background poll).

#### EVENT: terminal

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `done` | Produce final report (see Step 5), stop |
| `stopped` | Report "User stopped orchestration", stop |
| `time_limit` | Summarize progress (changes done/total, tokens, time elapsed), stop |

#### EVENT: process_exit (crash)

The orchestrator process exited. Handle with simple restart logic — do NOT read logs or diagnose errors unless rapid crash threshold is hit.

1. Check state.json status:
   ```bash
   STATUS=$(jq -r '.status // "unknown"' orchestration-state.json 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
   ```
   If `done`, `stopped`, or `time_limit` → treat as normal exit, produce completion report (Step 5).

2. Track rapid crashes: if the orchestrator ran less than 5 minutes since `last_start_time`, increment `rapid_crashes`.

3. If `rapid_crashes >= 5` → **stop and report**:
   - Read the last 50 lines of orchestration.log
   - Report the error pattern to the user
   - Do NOT restart

4. Otherwise → restart (no diagnosis needed — the orchestrator saves state and resumes):
   ```bash
   sleep 30
   set-orchestrate start $ARGUMENTS &
   ORCH_PID=$!
   ```
   Update `restart_count`, `last_start_time`, then go back to Step 2.

#### EVENT: checkpoint

Read the checkpoint reason from the event. Decision:

**If reason is `periodic`** — auto-approve:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json, os, tempfile
from datetime import datetime, timezone
with open('orchestration-state.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
if data.get('checkpoints'):
    data['checkpoints'][-1]['approved'] = True
    data['checkpoints'][-1]['approved_at'] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
fd, tmp = tempfile.mkstemp(dir='.', suffix='.tmp')
with os.fdopen(fd, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
os.rename(tmp, 'orchestration-state.json')
print('Checkpoint auto-approved (reason: periodic)')
"
```
Then go back to Step 2.

**If reason is anything else** (e.g., `budget_exceeded`, `too_many_failures`, `manual`, `token_hard_limit`):
- Report the checkpoint reason and current orchestration status to the user
- Wait for user input on whether to approve or stop
- Do NOT auto-approve non-periodic checkpoints

#### EVENT: stale

The state file hasn't been updated in >120s while status is "running":

1. Check if the orchestrator PID is still alive:
   ```bash
   kill -0 $ORCH_PID 2>/dev/null && echo "alive" || echo "dead"
   ```
2. Read last 20 log lines to understand what's happening
3. If PID alive + logs show activity → likely a long operation, go back to Step 2
4. If PID dead → treat as crash (go to process_exit handling)
5. If PID alive but no log activity for >5 minutes → report to user as potential hang

### Step 4: User interaction

**You can respond to user questions anytime between polls.** If the user asks about status, read the state directly:

```bash
jq '{status, changes: [.changes[] | {name, status}], tokens: .prev_total_tokens, active_seconds}' orchestration-state.json
```

Don't wait for the next poll cycle — just answer the user and the background poll will continue independently.

### Step 5: Completion report

When the orchestration reaches a terminal state, produce this report by reading state.json:

```bash
cat orchestration-state.json
```

Then format:

```
## Orchestration Report

- **Status**: done / time_limit / failed / stopped
- **Duration**: Xh Ym active / Xh Ym wall clock
- **Changes**: N/M complete (list failed ones if any)
- **Tokens**: X.XM total
- **Replan cycles**: N
- **Sentinel restarts**: N (with reasons if any)
- **Issues**: Notable errors or warnings from the run

### Per-Change Breakdown

| Change | Status | Tokens | Stuck? |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| name   | merged | 320K   |        |
| name   | failed | 680K   | ⚠ >500K, no commit 45min |
```

Read `active_seconds`, `started_epoch`, `changes[]`, `prev_total_tokens`, `replan_cycle` from state.json to fill in the report. For each change, include `tokens_used` and flag any that exceeded 500K tokens without recent commits.

## Examples

```bash
# Basic — supervise orchestration with defaults
/set:sentinel

# With spec and parallel limit
/set:sentinel --spec docs/v5.md --max-parallel 3

# With time limit
/set:sentinel --time-limit 4h
```

## Guardrails

### Role boundary: monitor, don't modify

The sentinel is a **supervisor**, not an engineer. Its authority is limited to:

1. **Observe** — poll state, detect process-level problems
2. **Restart** — restart after process crashes (only when rapid crash threshold is not hit)
3. **Stop** — halt when rapid crashes indicate a systemic problem
4. **Report** — produce completion reports and escalate to user when needed

The sentinel MUST NOT:
- Modify any project files (source code, configs, schemas, package.json, etc.)
- Modify `.claude/orchestration.yaml` or any orchestration directives
- Run build/generate/install commands that change project state
- Merge branches or resolve conflicts
- Create, edit, or delete worktrees beyond what `set-orchestrate` manages
- Make architectural or quality decisions on behalf of the user
- Diagnose orchestration-level issues (merge conflicts, test failures, change failures) — these are the orchestrator's responsibility
- Reset orchestration state from running to stopped — the orchestrator handles stale state on resume

**If the sentinel cannot fix a problem with a simple process restart, it MUST stop and report.** Another agent (or the user) will make the fix, then the sentinel can be restarted to continue.

### NEVER weaken quality gates

Specifically, the sentinel MUST NEVER remove, disable, or modify:
- `smoke_command` — even if smoke tests fail repeatedly (port mismatch failures are expected pre-merge, retries handle them)
- `test_command` — or any other test directive
- `merge_policy`, `review_before_merge`, `max_verify_retries`

If tests fail persistently → **stop and report to the user**, do NOT weaken the gates.

## E2E Mode (Tier 3)

When running E2E tests (see `tests/e2e/E2E-GUIDE.md`), the sentinel gains **Tier 3 authority** — the ability to fix set-core framework bugs and deploy them to the running test.

### Tier 3 Scope Boundary

| ALLOWED | FORBIDDEN |
|---------|-----------|
| Edit files in set-core repo (bin/, lib/, .claude/, docs/) | Consumer project source code (src/, app/, components/) |
| git commit in set-core repo | Branch merge/resolve in consumer project |
| `set-project init` (deploy .claude/ to consumer) | Edit orchestration-state.json directly |
| `cp -r .claude/` to active worktrees | Weaken quality gates (smoke_command, test_command, etc.) |
| Kill + restart sentinel/orchestrator/agents | Make architectural or design decisions |

### Tier 3 Workflow

1. **Detect** — framework bug identified during monitoring (dispatch error, path resolution, state machine bug)
2. **Fix** — edit the relevant file in the set-core repo
3. **Commit** — `git commit` with clear message referencing the bug
4. **Deploy** — `set-project init` in the consumer project to sync `.claude/` files
5. **Sync worktrees** — `cp -r .claude/` to each active worktree
6. **Kill** — stop sentinel + orchestrator + agent processes
7. **Restart** — start fresh sentinel
8. **Log** — `set-sentinel-finding add --severity bug --summary "..."` with commit hash

### When Tier 3 Does NOT Apply

- Regular (non-E2E) orchestration runs — sentinel stays at Tier 1/2 only
- App-level bugs (build failures, test failures in consumer project) — leave to orchestrator
- Design or scope decisions — stop and report to user

## What happens

1. Orchestrator starts in background
2. Sentinel polls state.json every 30 seconds using background commands (non-blocking)
3. You remain responsive to user messages between polls
4. On events (crash, checkpoint, completion, stale), the agent makes a decision
5. `EVENT:running` is handled instantly — no analysis, just start next poll
6. Periodic checkpoints are auto-approved
7. Crashes trigger simple restart (no diagnosis unless rapid crash threshold hit)
8. On completion or failure, a summary report is produced
