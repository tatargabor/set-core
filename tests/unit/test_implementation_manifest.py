"""Unit tests for `_extract_implementation_manifest` — core (project-agnostic).

The extractor is project-agnostic at the core: it consumes
`profile.scope_manifest_extensions()` (file extension list) and
`profile.scope_manifest_extras(scope)` (project-type-specific section)
from the active profile. These tests pin the universal behavior with the
default profile (CoreProfile) — extensions = `json/yaml/yml/md/toml`,
no JSX extras.

Project-specific behavior (TSX/JSX files for web, .py files for python,
JSX `<Component>` extras) is tested in each module's own tests:
- `modules/web/tests/test_scope_manifest_web.py`
